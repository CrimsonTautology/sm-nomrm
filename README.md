SM_NOMRM (Nomination Remove)
===============
Sourcemod Plugin that provides a way for an admin to remove maps from a nomination

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Simply compile with the command 

> spcomp nomrm.sp

and put the compiled .smx file in your `"<modname>/addons/sourcemod/plugins"`
directory.

Also make sure you have the mapchooser, nominations and rockthevote plugins enabled on your server otherwise this plugin won't be of much use


USAGE:
------
When on a server with nomrm enabled simply type into chat:

> `!nomrm [map|username]`

And the map or user's map will be removed from the nomination list.
Calling just nomrm will give you a list of nominated maps that you can filter as you will.
